For hg18, our metric added these entries relevant to SRF:

Serum response factor (SRF) is a regulator of basic cellular processes, and has also been associated in more biological contexts as being  e.g. a regulator of actin cytoskeleton

Examples of cellular processes include nucleus, protein binding, cytoplasm, transcription, nucleotide binding, metal ion binding, zinc ion binding, rna binding, regulation of transcription, ATP binding (reported by GREAT paper)

DECREASED P-VALUE

Terms associated with regulation of cell processes, such as transcription factor activity, cellular metabolic process, biosynthetic process, and cell cycle process. We also saw a decreased p-value for cytoskeleton organization and actin filament bundle formation, similar to actin cytoskeleton terms cited by GREAT as an enrichment bound by SRF.
